# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers of **PQ-BANK** pledge to foster an open, inclusive, and professional environment.
Participation in this project is governed by mutual respect, collaboration, and technical integrity.

This project exists to advance **post-quantum cryptography education and engineering practices**, and all interactions should reflect that mission.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating professionalism and respect in discussions
- Welcoming constructive feedback and peer review
- Focusing on technical merit rather than personal opinions
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Using inclusive and considerate language

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Publishing private information without consent
- Deliberate misinformation or security negligence
- Introducing malicious code or backdoors
- Trolling, spamming, or disruptive behavior

---

## Security-Sensitive Responsibility

Because this repository deals with **cryptographic systems**, contributors must:

- Avoid publishing private keys, secrets, or credentials
- Follow responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities
- Never intentionally weaken cryptographic guarantees
- Clearly document any experimental or insecure code paths

---

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct.
They may remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate these principles.

Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent bans from participation.

---

## Reporting Issues

To report unacceptable behavior or concerns:

- Open a **private security advisory** (preferred), or
- Contact the maintainers via GitHub issues with appropriate discretion

All reports will be reviewed fairly and confidentially.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant and adapted for cryptography-focused open-source projects.
