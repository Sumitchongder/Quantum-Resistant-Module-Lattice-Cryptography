# Security Policy

## Overview

**PQ-BANK** is a security-sensitive project focused on post-quantum cryptography.
We take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

---

## Supported Versions

This repository is a **demonstration project**, not a production banking system.

Only the **latest `main` branch** is supported for security updates.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Instead:

1. Use **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred), or
2. Contact the maintainer privately via GitHub

Please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask reporters to:

- Allow reasonable time for investigation
- Avoid public disclosure until a fix or mitigation is available
- Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept

---

## Security Scope

This policy applies to:

- Cryptographic protocols and key handling
- Wallet encryption and password handling
- Client/server communication
- Audit logs and integrity mechanisms
- Dependency usage and configuration

Out of scope:

- Issues requiring physical device access
- Social engineering attacks
- Misuse of demo credentials

---

## Disclaimer

This project is **educational and demonstrative**.

It has **not undergone a formal security audit** and must not be used in production environments without:
- Independent cryptographic review
- Threat modeling
- Secure deployment hardening
